## Setup
If on Windows, I highly recommend installing WSL Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
> Start

> Search for "Windows Store"

> Open Windows Store

> Search for "Ubuntu"

> Select and install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

### Install NodeJS version 12.10.0

#### Mac
> https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.10.0/node-v12.10.0.pkg

#### Ubuntu
In terminal, run
> ``sudo apt-get install curl``

> ``curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -``

> ``sudo apt-get install nodejs``

#### Mac and Ubuntu

Check version with
> ``node -v``

> ``npm -v``

### Install Vue CLI globally.
> ``sudo npm install -g @vue/cli``

Check version
> ``vue --version``

In the project directory run
> ``npm run serve``

A working version of the client will be available at ``localhost:8080``. Changes will automatically be compiled and the page will refresh.

### Install n to manage node versions
> ``sudo npm install -g n``

> ``sudo n 8``
